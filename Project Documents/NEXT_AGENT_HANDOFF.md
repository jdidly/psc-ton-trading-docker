- ✅ Confidence thresholds raised: High (45%→65%), Medium (25%→50%)
- ✅ ML criteria strengthened: Requirements raised from 2/5 to 4/5 criteria
- ✅ HOLD signal filtering: Only high-quality HOLD signals used for training
- ✅ Expected 60-70% reduction in weak signals

### **3. Dashboard Issues Resolved** 📊
- ✅ SQL column errors fixed: Corrected database column name mismatches
- ✅ Database dashboard working at `http://localhost:8502`
- ✅ Direct launcher created: `start_database_dashboard.py`

### **4. Documentation Created** 📚
- ✅ **PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md** - Complete system overview and context
- ✅ **WORKSPACE_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step setup for new workspace
- ✅ **Current file** - Handoff summary for next agent

## 🎯 **PRIMARY QUESTION TO INVESTIGATE**

### **ML Training Database Integration Status** 🤖

**QUESTION**: Are the ML models actually using the historical database data for continuous learning?

**EVIDENCE FOUND**:
- ✅ ML Engine has `_load_from_database()` method that loads 5000+ historical signals
- ✅ LiveMicrostructureTrainer accepts `data_manager` parameter for database integration
- ✅ Continuous learning methods exist: `update_with_outcome()` and retraining logic
- ❓ **UNKNOWN**: Is the training loop actually running and updating models in production?

**FILES TO INVESTIGATE**:
- `src/ml_engine.py` - Lines 1117+ (database loading functionality)
- `src/models/live_microstructure_trainer.py` - Database integration implementation
- Production logs - Check if retraining is happening automatically
- `data/ml/` directory - Check if model files are being updated with new training

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Verify ML Training Pipeline** 🔍
```bash
# Test if ML models are loading historical data
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from ml_engine import MLEngine
from psc_database import PSCDatabase

db = PSCDatabase()
ml = MLEngine(data_manager=db)
print(f'Predictions loaded: {len(ml.predictions)}')
print(f'Database connected: {ml.data_manager is not None}')
"

# Check if LiveMicrostructureTrainer uses database
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from models.live_microstructure_trainer import LiveMicrostructureTrainer
from psc_database import PSCDatabase

db = PSCDatabase()
trainer = LiveMicrostructureTrainer(data_manager=db)
print(f'Trainer has database: {trainer.data_manager is not None}')
"
```

### **Step 2: Test Continuous Learning** 🧠
- Check if `update_prediction_outcome()` is being called in production
- Verify if ML models are actually retraining with new data
- Look for evidence of improving prediction accuracy over time

### **Step 3: Optimize System Performance** ⚡
- Fix Streamlit dashboard deprecation warnings (`use_container_width`)
- Consolidate multiple dashboard versions
- Optimize resource usage
